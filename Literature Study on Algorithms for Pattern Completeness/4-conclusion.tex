\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
The paper set out to explore algorithms for deciding pattern completeness in term rewrite systems. Pattern completeness is the notion that given a term rewrite system with left hand sides $L$ and basic ground term $f(t)$, the term is matched by some left hand side $\ell \in L$. The notion of quasi-reducibility was also introduced that relaxes the pattern completeness definition, allowing for matching to happen under the root.

The main focus of the literature review is to discuss the algorithm by Thiemann and Yamada\cite{thiemann} and compare and contrast it with the \textit{complement algorithm} of Lazrek et al. \cite{lazrek}. Moreover, frameworks using tree automata are proven useful for deciding pattern completeness and related definitions. Therefore, a short introduction of this construction is also discussed. Finally, a short survey of related literate is also included at the end of Section \ref{review}.

Further research, as discussed in Section \ref{discussion}, could explore a more detailed and exhaustive performance comparison of the discussed algorithms. Moreover, as per \cite{thiemann}, it remains open to construct a similar syntax-based algorithm to decide quasi-reducibility.
